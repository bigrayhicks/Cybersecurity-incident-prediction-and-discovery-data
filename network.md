|[6]| [Open recursive projects](http://openresolverproject.org/)|Open Resolvers pose a significant threat to the global network infrastructure by answering recursive queries for hosts outside of its domain. They are utilized in DNS Amplification attacks and pose a similar threat as those from Smurf attacks commonly seen in the late 1990s. A list of 32 million resolvers that respond to queries in some fashion are collected in this project.|
